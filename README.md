# Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of remote work on employees' mental health. With the growing trend of remote work, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to understand how this shift affects overall well-being.

## Background
Remote work offers flexibility and convenience for many employees. However, research indicates that social isolation, blurred boundaries between work and personal life, and increased screen time can contribute to mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression.

## Objectives
- Analyze data related to employees' mental health in a remote work setting.
- Identify factors contributing to mental health challenges.
- Provide recommendations to improve the well-being of remote workers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of surveys from employees across various industries working remotely. The data includes demographic information, working hours, work environment, physical activities, and mental health indicators. The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle: [Remote Work and Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iramshahzadi9/remote-work-and-mental-health)

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather survey data from relevant sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Use statistical techniques and machine learning to identify patterns and correlations.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations of key findings.
5. **Report Generation**: Summarize insights and recommendations in a comprehensive report.

## Findings
Preliminary analysis suggests that factors such as lack of social interaction, inadequate work environments, and irregular working hours significantly contribute to decreased mental well-being in remote workers. Conversely, flexible work hours and reduced commuting time have a positive impact.

## Dashboard
I have created interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize key findings from the analysis. These dashboards provide insights into how remote work affects mental health through various metrics and comparisons. You can explore them using this links [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ferryansa./viz/M1_ferryansa/Dashboard1?publish=yes).

## Recommendations
- **Encourage Social Interaction**: Conduct regular virtual meetings and team activities to foster engagement.
- **Set Clear Work Boundaries**: Promote structured work hours and adequate break times.
- **Provide Mental Health Support**: Offer access to counseling services and mental health resources.
